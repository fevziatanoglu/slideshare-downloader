Features:

Next.js: This app is built on top of Next.js, which is a React framework known for building awesome server-side/client-side rendered and statically generated web apps.
Get Images' URL: Using Cheerio, the app can fetch the URLs of all the images in the presentation.
Convert URL to Base64: To avoid any CORS errors, the app converts the image URLs to base64 format.
Create PPTX File: With the help of Pptxgen.js library, the app creates a PowerPoint file containing all the images in base64 format, making it super easy for you to download and use offline.
Responsive Design: Of course, it's gotta look good on all devices, so I've made sure the app has a simple and responsive design using Tailwind CSS.
